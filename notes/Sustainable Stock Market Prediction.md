Sustainable Stock Market Prediction Framework using Machine Learning model. Francisco Jose Garcia Penalvo et al.

Stock price prediction using auto-regressive model, where the output is defined as the linear combination of it's past value and the present values of the input variables. (**Dr. P.K. Sahoo, 2015**)

Multiple algorithm analyses of stock market and prediction (**Alamir Labib Awad, 2021**). Author has discussed techniques like: K-NN regression, DRL (Deep Reinforcement Learning), BERT for sentiment analysis, MAS simulator to simulate the stock movements, LSTM for trading, combining LSTM (for prediction) with C-NN (for feature extraction), etc.

Above study underscored LSTM as the best model for stock price forecasting or prediction.

Stock market is quite similar to a telephone that connects the caller and the receiver. It is because it serves as a platform for investors where they can purchase stocks, bonds, commodities and so on.. which means it does the task of connecting the buyers and sellers like a telephone.

All the stock exchanges in the world combined is worth $89.5 trillion (Trade Brains, n.d.)

### Factors affecting Stock Market

- Interest rates (low interest rates = attractive market for investing)
- Economic growth (rising economy helps in increasing a company's profit)
- Investor's emotions (investments are affected by emotions like fear, greed, anger etc)
	If positive and good news are received, one will most likely buy the stock and vice versa. The panic to sell quickly can start recession.
- Inflation/Deflation rates
	Inflation means the rate at which the prices of goods and services increase.
	Conversely, Deflation is the condition in which the prices of goods and services decrease.
- World Events (wars, natural calamities, epidemics, elections)


First fully computerized platform for the stock market was offered by NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) in 1996.

According to the author, Decision Tree Regression is effective to predict the stock market because it can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets.
